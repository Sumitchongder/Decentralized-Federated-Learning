# Contributing to the Decentralized Federated Learning Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.
This repository represents a **security-critical, decentralized learning system**
and contributions are reviewed with rigor.

---

## Contribution Areas

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Decentralized aggregation algorithms
- Gossip and P2P communication protocols
- Secure aggregation and cryptographic primitives
- Blockchain consensus or ledger integration
- Performance benchmarking and scalability studies
- Documentation, diagrams, and reproducibility tooling

---

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Security First

- Never introduce insecure defaults
- Avoid hard-coded keys, secrets, or credentials
- Cryptographic changes must be well-justified and documented

---

### 2. Decentralization Integrity

- No contribution should introduce implicit centralization
- Peer-to-peer assumptions must be preserved
- Consensus logic must be deterministic and auditable

---

### 3. Reproducibility

- Provide deterministic configurations where possible
- Document assumptions, parameters, and system topology
- Benchmark results must include setup details

---

## Code Standards

- Follow **PEP 8** and Python best practices
- Write modular, readable, and testable code
- Add docstrings to public classes and functions
- Prefer configuration files over hard-coded constants

---

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
````

3. Make small, atomic commits with clear messages
4. Test locally before submitting
5. Push to your fork
6. Open a Pull Request with a detailed description

---

## Pull Request Requirements

Each PR should include:
